    Projects 3D vertex positions onto the image plane of the camera.

    Args:
        v (th.Tensor):  vertex positions. N x V x 3
        campos (Tensor): Camera position. N x 3
        camrot (Tensor): Camera rotation matrix. N x 3 x 3
        focal (Tensor): Focal length. The upper left 2x2 block of the intrinsic matrix
            [[f_x, s], [0, f_y]].  N x 2 x 2
        princpt (Tensor): Camera principal point [cx, cy]. N x 2
        K (Tensor): Camera intrinsic calibration matrix, N x 3 x 3
        Rt (Tensor): Camera extrinsic matrix. N x 3 x 4 or N x 4 x 4
        distortion_mode (List[str]): Names of the distortion modes.
        distortion_coeff (Tensor): Distortion coefficients. N x 4
        fov (Tensor): Valid field of view of the distortion model. N x 1

    Returns:
        Vertex positions projected onto the image plane of the camera. The last dimension has
        still size 3. The first two components are the x and y coordinates on the image plane,
        and the z is z component of the vertex positions in the camera frame. The latter is used
        for depth values that are written to the z-buffer. N x V x 3

    .. warning::
        You must specify either ``K`` (intrinsic matrix) or both ``focal`` and ``princpt``
        (focal length and principal point).

        Additionally, you must provide either ``Rt`` (extrinsic matrix) or both ``campos``
        (camera position) and ``camrot`` (camera rotation).

    .. note::
        If we split ``Rt`` of shape N x 3 x 4 into ``R`` of shape N x 3 x 3 and ``t`` of
        shape N x 3 x 1, then: ``camrot`` is ``R``, and ``campos`` is ``-R.T @ t``.
